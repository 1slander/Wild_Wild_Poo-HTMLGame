## About:

Wild Wild Poo is the first project I have created using and applying all the new concepts I have learnt from the Ironhack Web Developer Bootcamp module one. In this module we have been working on the front-end using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Game Story:

The world have become a very clean place after Covid, but after a few years of face masks and hand sanitizer, a hero has risen from the shadows of your toilet. To claim back his thrown of filth, he must fight back old enemies.

## Instructions:

The player will control Poo and will have to avoid any paper or soap hit. Using the space bar, the player will be able to shoot and destroy the enemy. Be aware that they have different HP and that there is a limit to the bullets.

The player must achieve the maximum score to win.
